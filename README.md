## Game Rules

1. Fill the 6x6 grid with colors.
2. Each color must appear exactly once in each row and column.
3. The game starts with some pre-filled cells based on the chosen difficulty.
4. Click on a cell to cycle through colors.
5. Use the hint button to highlight conflicts (cells with the same color in the same row or column).
6. Use the trash mode to easily clear filled cells.
7. The game is won when the grid is correctly filled according to the rules.

## Components
